# landrun

A lightweight, secure sandbox for running Linux processes using Landlock LSM. Think firejail, but with kernel-level security and minimal overhead.

## Features

- üîí Kernel-level security using Landlock LSM
- üöÄ Lightweight and fast execution
- üõ°Ô∏è Fine-grained access control for files and directories
- üîÑ Support for read-only and read-write paths
- ‚ö° Optional execution permissions for allowed paths
- üìù Configurable logging levels

## Requirements

- Linux kernel 5.13 or later with Landlock LSM enabled
- Go 1.24.1 or later (for building from source)

## Installation

### Quick Install

```bash
go install github.com/zouuup/landrun/cmd/landrun@latest
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zouuup/landrun.git
cd landrun
go build -o landrun cmd/landrun/main.go
sudo cp landrun /usr/local/bin/
```

## Usage

Basic syntax:

```bash
landrun [options] <command> [args...]
```

### Options

- `--ro <path>`: Allow read-only access to specified path (can be specified multiple times)
- `--rw <path>`: Allow read-write access to specified path (can be specified multiple times)
- `--exec`: Allow executing files in allowed paths
- `--log-level <level>`: Set logging level (error, info, debug) [default: "info"]

### Important Notes

- You must explicitly add the path to the command you want to run with the `--ro` flag
- For system commands, you typically need to include `/usr/bin`, `/usr/lib`, and other system directories
- When using `--exec`, you still need to specify the directories containing executables with `--ro`

### Environment Variables

- `LANDRUN_LOG_LEVEL`: Set logging level (error, info, debug)

### Examples

1. Run a command with read-only access to a directory:

```bash
landrun --ro /usr/bin --ro /lib --ro /lib64 --ro /path/to/dir ls /path/to/dir
```

2. Run a command with read-write access to a directory:

```bash
landrun --ro /usr/bin --ro /lib --ro /lib64 --rw /path/to/dir touch /path/to/dir/newfile
```

3. Run a command with execution permissions:

```bash
landrun --ro /usr/bin --ro /lib --ro /lib64 --exec /usr/bin/bash
```

4. Run with debug logging:

```bash
landrun --log-level debug --ro /usr/bin --ro /lib --ro /lib64 --ro /path/to/dir ls
```

## Security

landrun uses Linux's Landlock LSM to create a secure sandbox environment. It provides:

- File system access control
- Directory access restrictions
- Execution control
- Process isolation

Landlock is an access-control system that enables processes to securely restrict themselves and their future children. As a stackable Linux Security Module (LSM), it creates additional security layers on top of existing system-wide access controls, helping to mitigate security impacts from bugs or malicious behavior in applications.

### Landlock Access Control Rights

landrun leverages Landlock's fine-grained access control mechanisms, which include:

**File-specific rights:**

- Execute files (`LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_EXECUTE`)
- Write to files (`LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_WRITE_FILE`)
- Read files (`LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_FILE`)
- Truncate files (`LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_TRUNCATE`) - Available since Landlock ABI v3

**Directory-specific rights:**

- Read directory contents (`LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_DIR`)
- Remove directories (`LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REMOVE_DIR`)
- Remove files (`LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REMOVE_FILE`)
- Create various filesystem objects (char devices, directories, regular files, sockets, etc.)
- Refer/reparent files across directories (`LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER`) - Available since Landlock ABI v2

### Limitations

- Landlock must be supported by your kernel
- The sandbox applies only to file system operations
- Some operations may require additional permissions
- Files or directories opened before sandboxing are not subject to Landlock restrictions

## Kernel Compatibility Table

| Feature                            | Minimum Kernel Version | Landlock ABI Version |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| Basic filesystem sandboxing        | 5.13                   | 1                    |
| File referring/reparenting control | 5.17                   | 2                    |
| File truncation control            | 6.1                    | 3                    |

## Troubleshooting

If you receive "permission denied" or similar errors:

1. Ensure you've added all necessary paths with `--ro` or `--rw`
2. Try running with `--log-level debug` to see detailed permission information
3. Check that Landlock is supported and enabled on your system:
   ```bash
   grep -E 'landlock|lsm=' /boot/config-$(uname -r)
   ```
   You should see `CONFIG_SECURITY_LANDLOCK=y` and `lsm=landlock,...` in the output

## Future Features

Based on the Linux Landlock API capabilities, we plan to add:

- üåê Network access control
- üîí Enhanced filesystem controls
- üîÑ Process scoping
- üõ°Ô∏è Additional security features
